## Model menus

A SHORT press of the MENU key from the main views brings up the model selection screen. There models can be selected, deleted, backed up and restored to/form SD card using the menu brought up by a LONG press on the ENTER key. They can also be copied or moved (one SHORT press on ENTER key highlights the line, +/- create and place a copy of the model on the desired slot, while two SHORT presses create a dotted outline where +/- simply move the selected model to another slot.)
