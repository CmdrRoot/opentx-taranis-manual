## Model menus

A SHORT press of the MENU key from the main views brings up the model selection screen. There models can be selected, deleted, backed up and restored to/form SD card using the menu brought up by a LONG press on the ENTER key. They can also be copied or moved (one SHORT press on ENTER key highlights the line, +/- create and place a copy of the model on the desired slot, while two SHORT presses create a dotted outline where +/- simply move the selected model to another slot.)

### Logical switches

These are logic switches that are used to compare values and combine various conditions.
The first "operation" column lists a few arithmetical, logical and differential operations. In arithmetical ones a and b represent variables, x represents a constant. Variables can be every source, i.e. all those available in mixers, plus the 5 global variables and all telemetry values. In logical operations the available sources are all physical and other custom switches. Differential functions compare the variation of a variable since last match to another value.

* a~x: active when variable a is approximately equal to constant x (hysteresis added, as comparing a stick's value for example would pretty much never trigger an exact match)
* a<x, a>x: Active when variable a is smaller resp. greater than constant x
* |a|<x, |a|>x: Active when the absolute value of variable a is smaller resp. greater than constant x
* a<b,a>b,a=b: See above, but with 2 variables
* AND, OR, XOR: Logical and, or, exclusive or between 2 binary inputs
* d>x, |d|>x: Active when the selected variable, respectively its absolute value has changed by more than x since last time. For example, d>x Alt 10 would trigger once every time Altitude goes up by 10m. |d|>x Alt 10 would trigger once every time Altitude goes up OR down by 10m.
* TIM: A timer, TIM 0.5 2.0 would be active for 0.5s, inactive for 2s, and repeat.

Custom switches offer 3 more parameters: An extra AND condition (if selected, must be on for the custom switch to become active), a Duration parameter (the minimum time a custom switch will be active for even if its conditions become false instantly), and a delay parameter (that affects both activation and deactivation). See the title bar header to see the function of the field the cursor is on.
A long press of the ENTER key on a custom switch's label will bring up a popup menu that allows you to copy/paste/delete an entry for more convenient entry of similar settings.

### Special Functions

This is the place where switches can be used to trigger special functions such as trainer mode, soundtrack playback, speech output of variables etc.

The first column selects the trigger, which can be any switch (physical or custom) or ON (always on). A LONG press of the ENTER key will switch to "toggle" mode (ending with t), i.e. the selected input will be turned on when the selected switch is activated, and will remain on until it is deactivated and reactivated again.
Scrolling through the list you will also find a few more options: One (triggers just once when loading a model or turning the radio on), SHdownS (short press of the momentary switch), SHdownL (long press of the momentary switch).

The available functions are:
* Safety CHx: When active, the output of CHx is forced to the selected value. A checkbox is there to enable the function, which you would typically do after ensuring the value is set correctly and the switch is off if your model is powered.
* Trainer, TrainerXXX: Enables trainer mode globally, and for individual functions. Unless a custom function is set for an individual function, turning the one set for Trainer automatically activates all 4 sticks.
* Instant trim: When activating the selected switch the current stick positions will be added to their respective trims. This is typically assigned to a momentary switch, and used on a maiden flight if you expect trims to be way off. Instead of frantically clicking the trim tabs, you would hold the sticks so that the model flies straight, and depress the switch once. It is best to remove that entry after the maiden flight, to avoid hitting it by mistake and bringing the model badly out of trim again.
* Play Sound: Play a simple tone from the available list.
* Reset: Resets the selected item (Timer 1, Timer 2, telemetry values, or all of those)
* Vario: Turns on variometer sounds (see Telemetry setup)
* Play track: Plays a sound file from the SD card, with repeats at the specified interval
* Play value: Speaks the current value of the selected parameter, with repeats at the specified interval
* SD Logs: Logs the telemetry values to SD card at the specified interval
* Volume: Adjusts sound volume using the selected source
* Backlight: Turns backlight on
* BgMusic, BgMusic || (pause): Plays a selected soundtrack from the SD card. The BgMusic Pause item pauses the track when activated and resumes it once inactive again, while switching BgMusic off stops the track completely.
* Adjust GVx: When active, sets the relevant global variable to the value of the specified source. The adjustment source can be one of 4 groups cycled through using a LONG press of the ENTER key:
A fixed value
A proportional control, or a channel with for example specified curve/weight/offset to limit the adjustment range
Another GVAR
+1/-1, to increment/decrement the GVAR with each activation.
A long press of the ENTER key on a custom function's label will bring up a popup menu that allows you to copy/paste/delete an entry for more convenient entry of similar settings.

### Telemetry

This page groups all the basic telemetry-related settings.

A1 and A2 are the 2 analog ports available on D8R receivers. X8R receivers only have A1, which measures the receiver's power supply. Range sets the maximum measurable voltage, i.e. 3.3V / (divider ratio). For example with the receivers' internal sensor (1:4), this would be 13.2V. For the FBVS-01 sensor with the default ratio of 1:6, this would be 19.8V. The number next to "Ax channel" will show the currently measured value, and can be used to confirm or correct the Range setting by comparing the reading with an external voltmeter. Offset and custom units (A, m/s, m, ï¿½, %...) can be used in addition to help scaling the input to accomodate 3rd-party analog sensors.
"Low" and "Critical" alarms for A1, A2 and RSSI will trigger audio warnings when the measured value goes below the defined levels. When a microSD card with a Taranis voice pack loaded is present in the slot, those alarms will be announced in clear voice (e.g. "A1 Low", "A2 Critical", "RF signal Low"). If no card is present each will trigger a different beep pattern. We do recommend the use of the voice capability as 6 different beeps can be difficult to remember under stress.
Blades: Number of blades for the RPM sensor.
Voltage/current: Allows choosing the input for the power calculation and mAh count features. These should match the input you've connected the corresponding sensors to.
Variometer source: sensor type that is installed in your model. "Vario" is for the new FrSky vario sensors as well as the openxvario (vertical speed is calculated by the sensor and transmitted digitally), A1/A2 are for analog sensors that transmit vertical speed as a voltage connected to the respective input. Limit sets respectively the maximum expected sink rate, low and high dead band (no sound), and maximum climb rate for the sounds generated by the Vario custom function. The low dead band can be set to OFF, which disables sink tones altogether.
Following those basic parameters are the selection lists for the 3 custom telemetry screens that can be seen by LONG pressing the PAGE key on the main views. Each screen can either show numerical parameters (9 in the main screen area and 3 in the bottom bar), or 4 bargraphs with configurable upper/lower limits.
 
Each field can be one of the various available parameters, of course the corresponding sensors and/or hub must be installed in the model:
Tmr1,2: Both timers
SWR: Transmitter antenna quality. Should always be below 51, or a popup warning will appear and an audio alarm will sound to warn you to check the radio's antenna. The value itself is of little meaning.
RSSI: Lowest of the RSSI values from the radio and receiver in D8 mode. In D16 mode, RSSI of the receiver.
Alt: Barometric altitude sensor
Rpm: Engine speed, number of blades is adjusted in the settings above
Fuel: Fuel level
T1,T2: Temperature sensors 1 and 2
Spd, Dist, GAlt: GPS speed, distance from starting point and GPS altitude
Cell: Lowest cell on FLVS-01
Cels: Sum of all cells on FLVS-01
Vfas: FAS-40/100 voltage measurement
Curr: Current, source configured in the settings above (FAS or analog)
Cnsp: mAh used totalizer (needs current source configured correctly)
Powr: Power, voltage and current sources configured above
AccX,Y,Z: Acceleration values from TAS-01
Hdg: GPS heading
Vspd: Vertical speed (either calculated by the radio or reported by the sensor, depending on the sensor type chosen above)
xxx+/xxx-: Min and max values of the available parameters
