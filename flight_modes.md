# Flight Modes

Next up is the flight modes screen.

8 flight modes plus the default one are available for use. Each of them can be named, has a selectable activation switch (physical or logical), a trim selection array (R, E, T, A when shown mean the mode has its own trim setting for that control, but each can be changed to a number from 0 to 9 and thus use the same value as the specified mode), and slow up/down parameters for smooth transitions between modes.
The priority of the flight modes is such as the first FM of 1-8 that has its switch ON is the active one. When none has its switch ON, the default FM0 is active.
