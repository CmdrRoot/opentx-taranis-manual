# Introduction to OpenTX companion

OpenTX comes with a computer-based graphical user interface, OpenTX
Companion, that runs on Windows, Mac OS and Linux.  It is a great tool
to try things even without a radio. It can speed up new model setups
because the PC interface is not limited to a small screen and a few
buttons. Companion will allow you to:
 - Download and install OpenTX transmitter firmware
 - Simulate transmitters and models (Try before you buy or fly)
 - Edit transmitter and model configurations
 - Backup the transmitterâ€™s firmware, models and SD Card contents
 - Edit the OpenTX transmitter start up screen (splash screen)
