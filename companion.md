# Introduction to OpenTX companion

OpenTX comes with a computer-based counterpart that runs on Windows, Mac OS and Linux, OpenTX Companion.  This software will allow you to backup, edit and share your radio's settings.  It can also simulate both a model's setup and the radio's own interface on the computer.  It is a great tool to try things even without a radio.  It can speed up new model setups because the PC interface is not limited to a small screen and a few buttons.
