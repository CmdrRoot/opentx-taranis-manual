# Heli Setup

A SHORT press of the PAGE key will bring up the helicopter CCPM head mixer page. This page allows setting a swashplate type, and limiting the control authority through the Swash Ring setting.

The inputs of this mixer are the Ail and Ele sticks, plus the virtual channel selected in "Collective source". This channel would see entries added on the MIXER page for one or more pitch curves.
The outputs of the CCPM mixer are CYC1, CYC2 and CYC3, which need to be assigned on the MIXER page to the channels you will connect your servos to.
Note that the settings made here have no effect unless you are using those CYC1, CYC2 and CYC3 sources. A multirotor or flybarless helicopter which uses onboard computers/mixers will NOT use them.
