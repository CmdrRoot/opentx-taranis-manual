# Software overview

Now might be the time to put the battery on charge, so that after reading this section you can directly have a go at putting what you learned in practice!

## Button navigation

The Taranis has 6 input keys: a standard set of +/-/ENTER/EXIT, plus 2 contextual MENU and PAGE keys.
On the main views, the PAGE key will switch between the different views described in the next section. A LONG press of the PAGE key will bring up the telemetry display. A SHORT press of the MENU key will call the model menu, while a LONG press will call the radio settings menu. In those 2 menus, a SHORT press of the PAGE key goes to the next page, while a LONG press goes back to the previous one. EXIT goes back to the main views. In all model menu pages a long press of the MENU key will bring up a channel monitor to allow quickly checking the influence of a change in settings on the outputs.
The navigation in a menu is simple: The +/- keys will navigate up/down between editable fields, or lines of fields depending on the screen.
ENTER will enter the line of fields when applicable, then edit mode. In edit mode, +/- will change the value, ENTER or EXIT will validate the input and return to navigation. EXIT always goes back to the previous navigation level.
In edit mode, we have four 2-key shortcuts available:
* +/- together: Invert value
* -/ENTER: Set value to 100
* EXIT/PAGE: Set value to -100
* MENU/PAGE: Set value to 0
Another handy feature is the auto selection of physical inputs in the relevant fields. Instead of choosing a source or switch with the + and - keys, just move the pot or flick the switch you want, and it will be recognised. For switches the position is also auto-selected, and the +/- double key combination will allow selecting the opposite position (!Sxy) in a pinch.
