## Simulating the radio

You can now create a new document. A window will appear, with the  
first line being the radio's general settings, and the next being the  
model slots. You can have a look in the general settings and create a  
model by double-clicking in an empty slot.  There are 2 ways to  
simulate either a model or the whole radio.

* In the model editor, the bottom Simulate button will open the model
  simulator with the current settings. Note that if a change is made
  in the model while the simulator is open, it needs to be closed and
  reopened.
* At the bottom of the "document" window is a "Simulate Tx" button
  that will open a similar simulator, however this time with an extra
  tab showing the radio's LCD screen and UI buttons. The virtual radio
  will have the same data as the document when the simulator is
  started. Note that changes on the radio interface are not carried
  over back to the document.
